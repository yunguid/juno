AWM2 (Advanced Wave Memory 2)
This instrument is equipped with an AWM2 tone generator block. AWM2 (Advanced Wave Memory 2) 
is a synthesis system based on sampled waves (sound material), and is used in many Yamaha 
synthesizers. For extra realism, each AWM2 Voice uses multiple samples of a real instrument’s 
waveform. Furthermore, a wide variety of parameters—envelope generator, filter, modulation, and 
others—can be applied.

FM-X
This synthesizer also features an FM-X tone generator, in addition to the AWM2 block. The 
abbreviation “FM” of FM-X stands for “frequency modulation,” which is a special tone generation 
system that uses the frequency of one waveform to modulate another waveform, in order to produce a 
completely new one. In this synthesizer, there are eight FM Operators and a full 88 different Algorithm 
types. By changing the operator combination patterns, controlling the modulation with other 
parameters such as levels and envelopes, and using high-quality filters, effects, and EQ commonly 
with AWM2, you can create richly textured sounds that change in a highly complex fashion.

Tone Generator Block
The tone generator block is what actually produces sound in response to the MIDI messages received 
from the Sequencer block, Controller block, Arpeggio block and from the external MIDI instrument. The 
MIDI messages are assigned to sixteen independent channels, and the instrument is capable of 
simultaneously playing sixteen separate Parts, via the sixteen MIDI channels. However, the sixteen-
channel limit can be overcome by using separate MIDI “ports,” each supporting sixteen channels. The 
tone generator block of this instrument can handle MIDI messages over Port 1.

Tone Generator block

Performances

A Performance is a single set of sounds consisting of multiple Parts. You can change sounds as desired by 
selecting the appropriate Performance. Each Performance has two types of parameters; parameters 
unique to each Part and parameters common to all Parts. You can edit the entire Performance in the 
Common/Audio Edit display (page 145).

Part structure of a Performance

A Performance consists of 16 Parts and you can create Performances (in which multiple Parts or Parts are 
combined—in a layer, or in other configurations) using the keyboard.

Parts

Internally, there are three Part types: Normal Parts (AWM2), Normal Parts (FM-X), and Drum Parts. Normal 
Parts (AWM2) are mainly pitched musical instrument type sounds that can be played over the full range of 
the keyboard. Normal Parts (FM-X) are also mainly pitched musical instrument type sounds, using FM 
synthesis. Drum Parts are mainly percussion/drum sounds that are assigned to individual notes. A Normal 
Part (AWM2) can consist of up to eight Elements, a Normal Part (FM-X) can consist of up to eight 
Operators, and a Drum Part can consist of up to 73 Drum Keys. 
An Element/Operator/Drum Key is the basic, smallest unit for a Part. By combining multiple Elements/
Operators/Keys, Parts can be created to produce even more realistic sounds or various richly textured 
types of sound. Each Part is created by editing parameters unique to each (Element Edit parameters/
Operator Edit parameters/Key Edit parameters) and parameters common to all the Elements/Operators/
Keys (Element Common Edit, Operator Common Edit, and Key Common Edit parameters.)
NOTE For instructions on editing a Normal Part (AWM2), see page 58. For instructions on editing a Normal Part (FM-X), 

see page 131. For instructions on editing a Drum Part, see page 119.

Element 3

Normal Parts (AWM2)
These Parts are played conventionally from the 
keyboard, with standard pitches sounding for each key, 
generated by AWM2. A Normal Part consists of up to 
eight Elements. Depending on the settings in the Part 
Edit, these Elements are sounded simultaneously, or 
different Elements are sounded according to the note 
range, velocity range and the XA (Expanded 
Articulation) settings (page 6).
The illustration shows an example of a Normal Part (AWM2). Since the six Elements here are distributed 
across both the note range of the keyboard and the velocity range, a different Element sounds depending 
on which note you play and how strongly you play it. In the velocity distribution, Elements 1, 3 and 5 sound 
when playing the keyboard softly, while Elements 2, 4 and 6 sound when playing it strongly. In the note 
distribution, Elements 1 and 2 sound in the lower range of the keyboard, Elements 3 and 4 sound in the 
middle range, and Elements 5 and 6 sound in the higher range. In the velocity distribution, Elements 1, 3 
and 5 sound when playing the keyboard softly, while Elements 2, 4 and 6 sound when playing it strongly. In 
a practical example of this in use, a piano Part could be composed of six different samples. Elements 1, 3 
and 5 would be the sounds of the piano played softly, over the respective note ranges, while Elements 2, 4 
and 6 would be strongly played sounds, for each respective note range. Actually, this instrument is even 
more flexible than this, since it allows up to eight independent Elements.

Element 5

Normal Parts (FM-X)
These Parts are also played conventionally from the keyboard, with standard pitches sounding for each 
key, generated by FM synthesis. The sound for a Normal Part (FM-X) is created by modulating a frequency 
of a fundamental waveform with another waveform. An operator that generates a fundamental waveform is 
a “carrier,” and an operator that modulates these waveforms is a “modulator.” The combination of a 
number of Operators is called “Algorithm.”
When the waveform output from the Operator is a simple sine wave, no harmonics are included other than 
the fundamental tone. However, you can create harmonics by modulating the waveform with other 
Operators. How harmonics can be created depends on the Modulators’ output levels and the frequency 
rates of Carriers and Modulators. On the other hand, the basic pitch is determined by Carrier’s frequency, 
and the output level is determined by the Carrier’s output level. The figure described below shows a basic 
way to create FM sound by using an analog synthesizer.

Modulator output level 
determines the Cutoff 
Frequency of the Filter.

Modulation

Modulator envelope determines 
the Filter envelope.

Modulator OP

Frequency ratio of the 
Modulator and the Carrier 
determines the base waveform 
including specific harmonics by 
the Oscillator.

Carrier OP

Carrier frequency determines 
the pitch of the Oscillator.

Carrier output level 
determines the volume 
by using the amplifier.

Carrier envelope determines 
the amplifier envelope.

Although the figure described above shows waveforms which are generated by two operators, the 
MONTAGE has eight Operators. The combination of a number of Operators is called an “Algorithm” and 
this synthesizer has parameters for setting the Algorithm.

Drum Parts
Drum Parts are mainly percussion/drum sounds 
that are assigned to individual notes on the 
keyboard (C0 to C6). Unlike Elements, a Drum 
key is equivalent to the corresponding note, 
meaning that you cannot change its range. 
Drum or percussion sounds are assigned to 
each Drum Key. You can create various types of 
Drum Parts by changing the drum or percussion sound assigned to each key and edit the parameters 
such as pitch and EG.

Expanded Articulation (XA)

Expanded Articulation (XA) is a tone generation system that provides greater performance flexibility and 
acoustic realism. This feature allows you to more effectively recreate realistic sound and natural 
performance techniques—such as legato and staccato—and provides other unique modes for random 
and alternate sound changes as you play.

Realistic legato performance
This instrument more accurately reproduces a legato effect by allowing specific Elements to be sounded 
when playing legato and other Elements to be played normally (with the XA Control parameter settings 
“Normal” and “Legato”).

Authentic note release sound
The MONTAGE reproduces these special, characteristic sounds by setting the XA Control parameter of 
certain Elements to “Key Off.”

Subtle sound variations for each note played
The MONTAGE more accurately reproduces these subtle sound variations by using the XA Control 
parameter settings “Cycle” and “Random.”

Switching among different sounds to recreate the natural performance on an 
acoustic instrument
Acoustic instruments have their own unique characteristics—even specific, unique sounds that are 
produced only at certain times in a performance. These include the flutter tonguing on a flute or the 
playing of high harmonics on an acoustic guitar. The MONTAGE recreates these by allowing you to switch 
between the sounds while you play—using the [ASSIGN 1]/[ASSIGN 2] buttons and the XA Control 
parameter settings, “A.SW1 On,” “A.SW2 On” and “A.SW Off.”
NOTE You can turn the [ASSIGN 1]/[ASSIGN 2] button on or off also by transmitting the Control Change number 

specified in the Common/Audio Edit display ([Control]  [Control Number]) (page 153) from an external device.

New sounds and new styles of playing
The highly versatile functions above can be applied effectively not only to acoustic sounds but also to 
synthesizer and electronic Parts as well. The XA feature opens up enormous potential for realizing 
authentic sounds, performing expressively and coming up with creative new styles of playing.

Motion Control System

The Motion Control System is a completely new feature for variably controlling Motions (rhythmical, 
multidimensional sound changes) in real time. This amazingly powerful feature dramatically and 
dynamically alters the sounds of the instrument in new, never-heard-before ways—changing texturally, 
rhythmically with the beats, providing cool, colorful lighting effects, and responding expressively to your 
creative passion. The Motion Control System has three main functions:

Super Knob:
For creating multi-dimensional sonic changes, and enhancing those changes with colorful, continually 
shifting lighting changes. Multiple parameters can be controlled simultaneously.

Motion Sequencer:
For continually variable sound changes. The powerful Motion Sequencer feature lets you dynamically 
change sounds by operating Parameters depending on sequences created in advance. It provides real 
time control for changing sounds depending on various sequences such as Tempo, Arpeggio, or the 
rhythm of external connected devices.

Envelope Follower:
Envelope Follower is a function for detecting the volume envelope of the input signal waveform and 
modifying sounds dynamically.
NOTE Envelope Follower can be controlled not only by the audio signal from an external device, but also by the output 

of all Parts.

Key Assign (Key Assign Mode)
Determines the playing method when the same notes are received continuously, and without 
corresponding note off messages. For details, refer to the Synthesizer Parameter Manual PDF document.
Settings: Single, Multi 

Single: Double or repeated playback of the same note is not possible. The first note will be stopped, then the next 
note will be sounded.
Multi: All notes are sounded simultaneously. This allows playback of the same note when it is played multiple times 
in succession (especially for tambourine and cymbal sounds that you would want to ring out to their full decay).

Arp Play Only (Arpeggio Play Only)
Determines whether or not the current Part plays only the note events of the Arpeggio playback. When this 
parameter is set to on, only the note events of the Arpeggio playback affect the tone generator block.
Settings: Off, On

Element Pan (Element Pan Switch)
Determines whether the individual pan settings for each Element (made via ([EDIT]  Part selection  
Element selection  [Amplitude]  [Level/Pan]  “Pan”) are applied or not. When this is set to “off,” the 
pan position for each Element in the Part is set to center.
Settings: Off, On

Velocity Limit 
Determines the minimum and maximum values of the velocity range within which each Part will respond. 
Each Part will only sound for notes played within its specified velocity range. If you first specify the 
maximum value and then the minimum value, for example “93 to 34,” then the Velocity range covers both 
“1 to 34” and “93 to 127.” For instructions on setting the Velocity Limit, refer to the Owner’s Manual.
Settings: 1 – 127

Note Limit 
Determines the lowest and highest notes of the keyboard range for each Part. Each Part will only sound for 
notes played within its specified range. If you first specify the highest note and then the lowest note, for 
example “C5 to C4,” then the note range covers both “C-2 to C4” and “C5 to G8.”
Settings: C -2 – G8

Osc/Tune (Oscillator/Tune)

From the Oscillator/Tune display you can assign the waveform (or basic sound material) to each Element. 
You can set the note range for the Element (the range of notes on the keyboard over which the Element will 
sound) as well as the velocity response (the range of note velocities within which the Element will sound).

Bank (Waveform Bank)
Number (Waveform Number)
Category (Waveform Category)
Sub Category (Waveform Sub Category)
Name (Waveform Name)
Indicates the information of the waveform used for the selected Element. “Bank” indicates which waveform 
location (Preset, User and Library) is assigned to the Element.
Settings: See the Data List PDF document.

Element Switch 
Determines whether the currently selected Element is on or off.
Settings: Off, On 

XA Control 
Determines the functioning of the Expanded Articulation (XA) feature of an Element.
The XA feature is sophisticated tone generator system that allows you to more effectively recreate realistic 
sound and natural performance techniques. It also provides other unique modes for random and alternate 
sound changes as you play. For details on the XA feature, see the “Tone Generator Block” in the “Basic 
Structure” on page 6. 
Settings: Normal, Legato, Key Off, Cycle, Random, A.SW Off, A.SW1 On, A.SW2 On

For each Element, you can set to:
Normal: The Element sounds normally each time you play the note.
Legato: When the Mono/Poly parameter is set to Mono, this Element will be played in place of the one which is set to 
“Normal” of the XA Control parameter when you play the keyboard in legato fashion (playing the next note of a 
single-note line or melody before releasing the previous note).
Key Off: The Element will sound each time you release the note.
Cycle (for multiple Elements): Each Element sounds alternately according to its numerical order. In other words, 
playing the first note will sound Element 1, the second note Element 2, and so on.
Random (for multiple Elements): Each Element will sound randomly each time you play the note.

Determines the lowest and highest notes of the keyboard range for each Element. Each Element will only 
sound for notes played within its specified range. If you first specify the highest note and then the lowest 
note, for example “C5 to C4,” then the note range covers both “C-2 to C4” and “C5 to G8.”
Settings: C -2 – G8

Pitch/Key (Pitch Key Follow Sensitivity)
Determines the sensitivity of the Key Follow effect (the pitch interval of adjacent notes), assuming the pitch 
of the Center Key (below) as standard.
Settings: -200% – +0% – +200%

+100% (the normal setting): Adjacent notes are pitched one semitone apart.
0%: All notes have the same pitch as the Center Key.
Negative values: The settings are reversed.

Center Key (Pitch Key Follow Sensitivity Center Key)
Determines the central note or pitch for the Key Follow effect on pitch.
Settings: C -2 – G8

Edit Waveform
Calls up the Waveform Edit display.
From this display you can set parameters related to Key Banks consisting of the Waveform.

(cid:129) Key Bank

A Key Bank is digital audio data, made by directly recording a signal, such as that of vocals or 
electric guitar, to this instrument.
Throughout this manual, the words “Key Bank” and “Wave” are sometimes used interchangeably; 
however, you should be careful to distinguish between “Key Bank” (raw audio data) and “Waveform” 
(collected audio data used to make up a Part).

(cid:129) Key Bank and Waveform

Key Banks are assigned and stored to Waveforms on the MONTAGE.
Each of the Waveforms can contain multiple Key Banks. To assign these Key Banks to a different 
space or container, you can set the note limit and velocity limit for each Key Bank. With this setting, 
the different Key Bank is played back depending on the pressed note and its velocity.

Resonance 
Width 
This parameter’s function varies according to the selected Filter Type. If the selected filter is an LPF, HPF, 
BPF (excluding BPFw), or BEF, this parameter is used to set the Resonance. For the BPFw, it is used to 
adjust the frequency bandwidth. This parameter is used to set the amount of Resonance (harmonic 
emphasis) applied to the signal at the cutoff frequency. This can be used in combination with the “Cutoff” 
parameter to add further character to the sound. For the BPFw, this parameter is used to adjust the width 
of the band of signal frequencies passed by the filter.
This parameter is not displayed depending on the selected Filter Types.
Settings: 0 – 127

Cutoff/Key (Cutoff Key Follow Sensitivity)
Determines the degree to which the notes (specifically, their position or octave range) affect the Cutoff 
Frequency (above). The Center Key (next parameter) is used as the basic Cutoff Frequency for this 
parameter.
Settings: - 200% – +200%

Positive values: The Cutoff Frequency drops for lower notes and rises for higher notes.
Negative values: The Cutoff Frequency rises for lower notes and drops for higher notes.

Center Key (Cutoff Key Follow Sensitivity Center Key)
This indicates that the central note for “Cutoff/Key” above is C3. Keep in mind that this is for display 
purposes only; the value cannot be changed.

Gain 
Sets the Gain (the amount of boost applied to the signal sent to the Filter Unit).

 In case of the Filter Type with “Distance” and “Res/Vel” parameters

Distance 
Determines the distance between the Cutoff Frequencies for the Dual Filter types and the LPF12+BPF6 
filter. This parameter is not displayed depending on the selected Filter Type. 
Settings: -128 – +127

Res/Vel (Resonance Velocity Sensitivity)
Determines the degree to which Resonance responds to Velocity, or the strength with which you play 
notes. This parameter is not displayed depending on the selected Filter Type. 
Settings: -64 – +63

Positive values: The higher the Velocity, the greater the Resonance.
Negative values: The lower the Velocity, the greater the Resonance.
0: No change of the Resonance value.

Level/Vel (Level Velocity Sensitivity)
Offset (Level Velocity Sensitivity Offset)
Curve (Level Velocity Sensitivity Curve)
Determines how the actual Velocity will be generated according to the Velocity (strength) with which you 
play notes on the keyboard. The Offset parameter raises or lowers the level specified by the “Level/Vel.” 
If the result is higher than 127, the velocity is set to 127. The Curve parameter lets you select from five 
different preset velocity curves (graphically indicated in the display) that determine how velocity affects the 
actual Velocity. In the illustrations below, the vertical axis indicates the actual resulting Velocity and the 
horizontal axis indicates Velocity with which you play notes.
Settings: Level/Vel: -64 – +63

Positive values: The more strongly you play the keyboard, the more the output rises.
Negative values: The more softly you play the keyboard, the more the output rises.
0: The output level does not change.

Keyboard Transpose 
This parameter is used to transpose the current zone in units of one semitone.
Settings: -11semi – +11semi
NOTE If you transpose beyond the note range limits (C -2 – G8), notes in the adjacent octaves will be used.

Keyboard Velocity Curve 
These five curves determine how the actual velocity will be generated and transmitted according to the 
velocity (strength) with which you play notes on the keyboard. The graph shown in the display indicates 
the velocity response curve. (The horizontal line represents the received velocity values (strength of your 
playing), while the vertical line represents the actual velocity values transmitted to the internal/external 
tone generators.)
Settings: Normal, Soft, Hard, Wide, Fixed

Normal: This linear “curve” produces one-to-one correspondence between the strength of your keyboard playing 
(velocity) and the actual sound change.
Soft: This curve provides increased response, especially for lower velocities.
Hard: This curve provides increased response, especially for higher velocities.
Wide: This curve accentuates your playing strength by producing lower velocities in response to softer playing and 
louder velocities in response to harder playing. As such, you can use this setting to expand your dynamic range.
Fixed: This setting produces the same amount of sound change (set in Keyboard Fixed Velocity below), no matter 
what your playing strength. The velocity of the notes you play are fixed at the value set here.

Keyboard Fixed Velocity 
The Fixed curve can be used to send a fixed velocity to the tone generator regardless of how hard or soft 
you play the keyboard. This parameter is only available if you select the “Fixed” Keyboard Velocity Curve 
above.
Settings: 1 – 127
